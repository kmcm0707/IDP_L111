# IDP_L111
This is the github repository for our IDP project.

## Project Description
"The ultimate objective is to find coloured blocks, determine their colour and deliver to the correct area based on
their colour. The block can be delivered to the floor of the delivery area or onto the truck for extra points. The area
contains white lines for guidance. An obstacle is situated between the starting and the drop off areas and the
collection area which can be avoided by using either a ramp or tunnel. Each time a block is transported back across
the obstacle a new block will be placed on one of the collection markers."

## Code
The final code for this project was 'CV/moveToPoint_modular.py' and 'arduino\MQTT_connection_keyboard_control\MQTT_connection_keyboard_control.ino'.

## Result
We were able to come 2nd overall in the competition, and were the only team to implement a computer vision solution.
In the final competition, we were able to successfully identify the blocks and deliver them to the correct area as well as place them on-top of the truck.
However we experienced a lag spike between the computer vision and the arduino, which caused the robot to run out of time before it could return to the starting area after it delivered the block on-top of the truck.
However 20 seconds after the time ran out, the robot was able to return to the starting area.
In spite of this issue, we were able to come 2nd overall in the competition so were still extremely happy.
Overall, we were very happy with the result and the project as a whole as it acted as a massive learning opportunity.
