## Code for computer vision

### Installing Dependencies run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Tips
I recoommend adding `env` (virtual environment directory) under `IDP_L111/` so
you can run the files easily by doing:

    ./main.py
without having to activate the virtual envirionemtn everytime.

But you need to give the file execution privlage by doing:

    chmod +x main.py
